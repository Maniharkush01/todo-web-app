This project was developed under a strict time constraint.
The overall architecture and workflow were inspired by an open-source MERN To-Do application.
This submission demonstrates my understanding of full-stack development concepts such as
CRUD operations, REST APIs, and frontend-backend integration.



 Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js (Express)
